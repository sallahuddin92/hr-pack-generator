🇲🇾 Malaysian SME HR Pack GeneratorThis project is a decoupled web application that generates a custom HR pack.Frontend: index.html (a static file you deploy to Netlify).Backend: app.py & requirements.txt (a Python Flask API you deploy to Render).This is a 2-file backend, which is simpler to manage.Deployment InstructionsYou must deploy the two parts separately.Part 1: Deploy the Backend API to RenderPush to GitHub:Create a new private GitHub repository.Add these two files: app.py and requirements.txt.Commit and push your code.Create a New Render Web Service:On your Render dashboard, click "New +" and select "Web Service".Connect the GitHub repository you just created.Configure the Service:Name: hr-pack-api (or any name you prefer).Root Directory: Leave blank.Environment: Python 3.Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txtStart Command: gunicorn app:app (This tells Render's server to run the app object inside your app.py file).Deploy:Click "Create Web Service".Wait for the deploy to finish. When it's "Live", copy your new API URL. It will look like this:https://hr-pack-api.onrender.comPart 2: Configure and Deploy the Frontend to NetlifyEdit index.html:Open index.html on your computer.Find the line const API_ENDPOINT = "...".Paste your Render URL into this variable. Make sure to add the /generate-pack endpoint!It should look like this:const API_ENDPOINT = "https://hr-pack-api.onrender.com/generate-pack";Save the file.Deploy to Netlify:Log in to your Netlify account.Go to the "Sites" tab.Drag and drop your index.html file directly onto the Netlify dashboard.Netlify will instantly deploy it and give you a public URL (e.g., https://some-random-name.netlify.app).Part 3: You're Done!You can now send the Netlify link to your customers. When they fill out the form, the JavaScript in index.html will send their data to your Render API (app.py), which will do the work and send the .zip file right back to their browser.
